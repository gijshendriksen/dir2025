# Present Your Work
At this full-day event there will be plenty of opportunities for students, academics, and industry professionals to interact and learn from one another. 
In DIR 2025, we are excited to continue the dialogue on diversity and inclusion within the IR community. 
DIR 2025 will also feature special sessions shining a spotlight on the region's ongoing research. 
We invite you to submit contributions in three categories

1. **Published work:** Share your research papers published in the past year at IR-related venues like SIGIR, ECIR, ACM TWeb, and more.
2. **Research spotlight:** This category aims to spotlight emerging research directions from young academics in the region.
3. **Resources:** This refers to demos, datasets, experimental platforms (already presented at other venues) that are of interest to the IR community. We also welcome European projects seeking exposure among workshop attendees, attending this event, as well as aiming to foster new partnerships, and for recruiting purposes.

Please note that the special sessions have limited presentation slots available. Our goal is to curate a diverse program that reflects the breadth of IR research across the Belgian and Dutch communities. Accepted contributions in the published work and research spotlight categories will receive a 15-minute oral presentation (12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&A), while resources will be presented as posters.
