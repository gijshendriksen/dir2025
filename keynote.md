#### Keynote Abstract
Policies and regulations are some of the pillars of responsible computing. Their goals are broad: from user data protection, through securing the rights of training data contributors, to addressing broader considerations such as protecting society from systemic risks. Yet, despite the growing number of such regulations, the practical implementation of their underlying requirements in information access systems often falls short. This talk will explore the computational and organizational factors contributing to these shortcomings and discuss how researchers and practitioners can contribute to improved governance of information access technologies in the public interest.
